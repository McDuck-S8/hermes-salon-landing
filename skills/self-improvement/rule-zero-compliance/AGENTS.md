# rule-zero-compliance — Skill

## Purpose
Rule 0 (Zero Artifact Rule) enforcement — every claim must have a verifiable artifact. No artifact = lie. Stop. Admit. Fix infrastructure first.

## Ownership
Managed by Hermes Agent. Self-contained skill with SKILL.md, references/, templates/, scripts/.

## Local Contracts
- **Triggers**: auto-detected from context
- **Required tools**: standard Hermes tools
- **Config**: config.yaml in skill dir (optional)

## Work Guidance
**When to use**: Rule 0 (Zero Artifact Rule) enforcement — every claim must have a verifiable artifact
**Common patterns**: Standard skill invocation
**Anti-patterns**: Using without reading SKILL.md first

## Verification
- Load SKILL.md and validate frontmatter
- Run any test scripts in scripts/
- Verify references/ files exist
