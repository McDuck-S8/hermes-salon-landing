# Apple Notes — Detailed Reference

## When to Use

- User asks to create, view, or search Apple Notes
- Saving information to Notes.app for cross-device access
- Organizing notes into folders
- Exporting notes to Markdown/HTML

## When NOT to Use

- Obsidian vault management → use the `obsidian` skill
- Quick agent-only notes → use the `memory` tool instead

## All Commands

### View Notes

```bash
memo notes                        # List all notes
memo notes -f "Folder Name"       # Filter by folder
memo notes -s "query"             # Search notes (fuzzy)
```

### Create Notes

```bash
memo notes -a                     # Interactive editor
memo notes -a "Note Title"        # Quick add with title
```

### Edit Notes

```bash
memo notes -e                     # Interactive selection to edit
```

### Delete Notes

```bash
memo notes -d                     # Interactive selection to delete
```

### Move Notes

```bash
memo notes -m                     # Move note to folder (interactive)
```

### Export Notes

```bash

```

## Limitations
